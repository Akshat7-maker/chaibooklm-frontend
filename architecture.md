# Vision

This project aims to build an application similar to Google's NotebookLM.

Instead of being a simple "Chat with PDF" application, users can create notebooks that contain multiple knowledge sources.

Examples:

* PDF
* YouTube Videos
* Websites
* VTT Files
* DOCX
* TXT
* Audio (future)

The AI should answer questions using **only the resources inside the selected notebook**.

---

# Goals

* Multiple notebooks per user
* Multiple resource types
* Fast ingestion pipeline
* Production-ready RAG architecture
* Real-time processing updates
* Streaming AI responses
* Scalable architecture
* Clean separation of responsibilities

# Why This Architecture?

Heavy operations like:

* PDF Parsing
* Chunking
* Embedding Creation

can take several seconds.

Instead of blocking the API:

```text
Upload

↓

Wait 30 seconds

↓

Response
```

we do

```text
Upload

↓

Create Job

↓

Return immediately

↓

Worker processes in background
```

This provides a much better user experience.

# Database Design

PostgreSQL stores application state.

## User

Stores authentication information.

Relationships

```
User

↓

Many Notebooks
```

Fields

* id
* name
* email
* password

---

## Notebook

Represents a workspace.

Relationships

```
Notebook

├── Resources

├── Conversations

└── Summaries
```

Fields

* title
* description

---

## Resource

Represents every uploaded source.

Examples

* PDF
* YouTube
* Website
* VTT

Fields

* title
* type
* status
* progress
* currentStep
* storagePath
* originalUrl
* indexedAt

Status lifecycle

```
UPLOADING

↓

PROCESSING

↓

READY
```

or

```
FAILED
```

---

## Conversation

Each notebook can have multiple conversations.

```
Notebook

↓

Conversation

↓

Messages
```

---

## Message

Stores

* User prompts
* AI responses

Each assistant message may include citations.

---

## Summary

Stores notebook-level AI generated summaries.

# Why We Don't Store Chunks in PostgreSQL

Chunks already exist inside Qdrant.

Duplicating them would create:

* extra storage
* synchronization problems
* unnecessary complexity

PostgreSQL stores metadata.

Qdrant stores semantic knowledge.

---

# Qdrant Design

One collection

```
knowledge
```

Not

```
pdf_collection

youtube_collection

website_collection
```

Everything lives together.

Filtering happens using metadata.

Example payload

```json
{
  "resourceId": "...",
  "userId": "...",
  "notebookId": "...",
  "sourceType": "PDF",
  "chunkIndex": 1,
  "page": 12,
  "text": "..."
}
```

---

# Resource Processing Pipeline

## Upload

```
User

↓

Upload PDF
```

---

## API

```
Express

↓

Save File

↓

Create Resource Record

↓

Queue Job

↓

Return Response
```

---

## Worker

```
Read Resource

↓

Choose Extractor

↓

Extract Text

↓

Chunk

↓

Embeddings

↓

Store in Qdrant

↓

Update PostgreSQL

↓

Emit Socket Event
```

---

# Extractor Architecture

Every resource type implements the same interface.

```
Extractor

↓

extract()

↓

Returns Text
```

Implementations

```
PDFExtractor

YouTubeExtractor

WebsiteExtractor

VTTExtractor

DOCXExtractor
```

Each returns the same normalized structure.

```ts
{
    title: "...",
    content: "...",
    metadata: {}
}
```

This allows the rest of the pipeline to remain unchanged regardless of source type.

---

# Chunking

All extractors eventually produce plain text.

```
Text

↓

Chunker

↓

Chunk 1

Chunk 2

Chunk 3
```

Chunking is completely independent of source type.

---

# Embedding

Every chunk becomes

```
Chunk

↓

Embedding Model

↓

Vector
```

---

# Vector Storage

Each vector contains

* embedding
* text
* metadata

Metadata

```
userId

notebookId

resourceId

chunkIndex

page

sourceType
```

---

# Chat (RAG) Pipeline

```
User Question

↓

Express

↓

Retrieve Notebook ID

↓

Search Qdrant

↓

Top K Chunks

↓

OpenAI

↓

Answer

↓

Stream Response
```

The LLM never searches all documents.

It only searches resources inside the current notebook.

---

# WebSocket Architecture

WebSockets are **not** used for chat.

Chat uses streaming HTTP responses.

WebSockets are used for

* upload progress
* processing updates
* notifications

Example

```
PROCESSING

↓

EMBEDDING

↓

INDEXING

↓

READY
```

The frontend updates immediately.

---

# Queue System

BullMQ is responsible for long-running jobs.

Queues

```
resource-processing

youtube-processing

embedding

summary-generation
```

Workers consume jobs independently from the API.

# API Design

Authentication

```
POST /auth/register

POST /auth/login
```

Notebook

```
GET /notebooks

POST /notebooks

PATCH /notebooks/:id

DELETE /notebooks/:id
```

Resources

```
POST /resources/upload

GET /resources

DELETE /resources/:id
```

Chat

```
POST /chat
```

---

# Security

Authentication

* JWT

Passwords

* bcrypt

Authorization

Every request validates ownership.

Users can only access


* their notebooks
* their conversations
* their resources

Qdrant searches always filter by

```
userId

AND

notebookId
```

to prevent cross-user data leakage.

---

# Future Improvements

* OCR support
* Image understanding
* Audio transcription
* Collaborative notebooks
* Notebook sharing
* Background summary generation
* Hybrid search (BM25 + Vector Search)
* Re-ranking
* Agentic workflows
* Notebook versioning
* Semantic caching
* Usage analytics
* Citation highlighting
* Multi-model support
* Document comparison
* Multi-tenant architecture
* Horizontal worker scaling

# Design Principles

This architecture follows a few important principles:

1. **Single Responsibility** — APIs, workers, vector storage, and the frontend each have a clearly defined role.
2. **Asynchronous Processing** — Heavy ingestion tasks run in background workers so API responses remain fast.
3. **Scalability** — Workers can be scaled independently of the API server.
4. **Extensibility** — New resource types can be added by implementing another extractor without changing the rest of the pipeline.
5. **Separation of Data** — PostgreSQL stores application state, while Qdrant stores semantic knowledge.
6. **Real-Time User Experience** — WebSockets provide live ingestion updates, while chat responses are streamed for responsiveness.

The result is a modular, production-oriented architecture that is easy to maintain, extend, and scale as new AI capabilities are introduced.
